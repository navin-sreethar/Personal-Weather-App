# **App Name**: AI or Not?

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allow users to upload images for analysis. Accept standard image formats.
- AI Detection: Use a pre-trained or fine-tuned AI model to analyze the image and determine the likelihood of it being AI-generated.
- Result Output: Clearly display the analysis results with a confidence score or probability, indicating how likely the image is AI-generated.
- Rationale Output: Generate a short description to explain why the tool made that choice

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 220, 70%, 60% which converts to the hex code #4A7BCC.  The app needs to feel modern and intelligent, so a moderately saturated, fairly bright, slightly cool blue shade is ideal.
- Background color: HSL 220, 20%, 95% which converts to the hex code #F0F2F5.  It needs to recede into the background and let the important visual information come to the foreground.  Therefore it is of the same hue as the primary, desaturated and quite light.
- Accent color: HSL 190, 70%, 50% which converts to the hex code #26A6A6.  It provides an element of interest but it is close enough to the blue family that it remains a calm, orderly visual experience.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear and modern readability. This font is suitable for both headlines and body text due to its clean, neutral design.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent concepts like image analysis, upload, and results.
- A clean, intuitive layout with a clear call to action for image uploading and a prominent display area for the results.
- Subtle animations and transitions during image processing and result display.
